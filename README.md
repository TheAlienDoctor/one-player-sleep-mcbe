# One player sleep for Minecraft Bedrock Edition

As of Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.20.20, you can now use the playersleepingpercentage gamerule for vanilla One Player Sleep. Because of that, this project has now been archived with one final release designed for older versions, in case people wish to use them. Please see the compatibility table below.

The aim of this pack is to create a one player sleep for Bedrock edition, but unlike most other one player sleeps doesn't change the behaviour of sleeping (e.g. speeding up how long you stay in a bed or having to be on top of the bed for one player sleep to work).

As well as this, you can optionally use the resource pack to turn certain texts in the game to make it clearer only one player has to sleep (see below in the features)

### Features
- Only one player will have to sleep to skip the night and change the weather to clear
- What makes this pack uniquid is that this pack doesnt change any other vanilla aspects of sleeping, for example it takes the same amount of time to sleep (unlike other packs)
- If you are using it with the resource pack then it will also change the vanilla text to say "x/1 players sleeping" and shorten the message in chat that says about every player needing to sleep to skip to day

### Compatability
**Note:** V1.2.0 is designed to be a universal version, but may cause minor content log errors. Most of the time this can just be ignored, but I would recommend only using that version if there is no other version that supports you Minecraft version.
| Pack version | Minecraft Version |
| - | - |
| V1.2.0 | 1.13.0 - 1.20.0 [Universal] |
| V1.1.2 | 1.20.10 - 1.20.30 |
| V1.1.1 | 1.19.80 - 1.20.0 |
| V1.1.0 | 1.19.50 - 1.19.70 |

Any version below this has issues, such as resetting the day count. I would not recommend using these versions.
